# üì± Samsung Galaxy Phone UI Replica with HTML and CSS
Created a stunning mobile user interface using only HTML and CSS. In this project, I attempted to replicate the calling UI of a Samsung Galaxy phone using HTML and CSS. The ` AIM ` of this project was to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS, as well as to explore the possibilities of creating a `mobile UI` using only these two languages.

# üé® Features
> A visually stunning replica of the calling UI of a Samsung Galaxy phone.

> Responsive design that looks great on any device, whether it's a desktop or a mobile phone.

> Easy-to-use interface that mimics the original Samsung Galaxy phone UI.

> Uses CSS animations to bring the UI to life.
